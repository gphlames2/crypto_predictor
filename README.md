# crypto_predictor
machine learning project to predict the price of crypto currencies exploring algorithms like LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM and RandomForestRegressor. 
a cluster of 20 crypto currencies with similar price movements was generated using K-means with the data scrapped from coinmarketcap. 
bitcoin data from Yahoofinance was used to train the models mentioned above and the non-linear model RandomForestRegressor had the best performance and was used to power the system.
